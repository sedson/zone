# notes
- gmail has a nice little widget for pop down spelling suggestions. not sure if i want to go all the way in terms of implementing closest word search but it could be a fun challenge
- i wanna understand the format of these dictionary files
- do i wanna actually implement line wrapping - could be fun?
- what about a little iframe component that gets the current token under the thing and shows an iframe if possible
