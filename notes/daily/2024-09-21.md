# todo

- [ ] cleanup folders
- [ ] typescript puzzles
- [ ] spend 1 hour making vals

- [ ] zone 
  - [x] dark mode
  - [.] config file to set up note directories 
    - [ ] would be cool if zone could edit this files and bun could watch that 

# links

- [okclh color tools](https://oklch.com/#70,0.1,205,100)
- [add global css to shadow root](https://eisenbergeffect.medium.com/using-global-styles-in-shadow-dom-5b80e802e89d)
- [color mix css prop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix)
  - the color picker on the demo here is really nice and worth looking into

## zone feature requests 
- don't rebuild the links bar if the emitted links don't change
- wrap width for the editor. still want the scroll bar to be and the right edge of the editor zone tho
