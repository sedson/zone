a paragraph.

what *about a paragraph* with a [link](inside of it) and stuff after it? still the same paragraph with a [link to today](#today).

[ ] a paragraph with a todo
[x] a paragraph with a done todo

- [ ] a list item with a todo
- [x] a list-item with a done todo

this p tag has back to back `code` `chunks` inside of it. `let a = m * x + b` here is a reference { ref } to another note. would be nice to make that clickable one day!

a block with *italic text* and **bold text**. Currently nesting bold and italic is not supported!
