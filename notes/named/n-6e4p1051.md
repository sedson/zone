Hi Active Theory team,

I'm excited to apply for your Junior Creative Developer role. I'm an experienced dev with a strong background in web, 3D, and game engineering. I love learning new workflows and building cutting-edge interactive web apps.

For the past 3 years, I've been at Bitsbox making 3D browser games for kids. I helped build our WebGL engine and tools, developed many of our game demos, designed and refactored our api, and worked closely (remotely) with a small team. My biggest project was a suite of games for Highlights Magazine. We made seven interlinked games that about 20,000 kids played each month. I led design and development on three games and contributed to all of them. I also wrote a data pipeline to optimize GLTF assets from Sketchup files, which might be useful for your work. The games were adored by the kids! 

Recently, I spent time at the Recurse Center diving into new web tech. I made WebGL games and demos, built a CPU renderer in Rust and WASM, and created a Lisp dialect for image manipulation.

I'm drawn to Active Theory because I want to use these skills on exciting client projects. I work hard, pay attention to details, and learn fast. I'm looking forward to contributing to the amazing work you do.

Cheers, 
Seamus Edson
