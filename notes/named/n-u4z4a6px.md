👋 Welcome Seamus! We’re excited to work together and see if there’s a fit. We’ll plan on 9am-5pm for the week.

# A successful work trial looks like:

- you make something compelling with val town, present it well, and get attention for it
- you are self-directed but know how to ask for help
- you learn and improve throughout the week
- we all have fun working together and it feels productive

In terms of sharing publicly, we are happy with either you sharing content under your own name and us boosting it or for you to “ghost write” by creating materials for us to share under our names. We don’t have a preference – whatever you’re more comfortable with works for us.

# project ideas

## update every hour physical website.

physical materials on a pin board. every hour a cron triggers and a webcam takes a picture of the pin board. run some ocr and push that to a live site. this would technically require some kind of other service connected to the webcam.

## codepen on val.town?

some kind of edit some code -> save -> share experience. probably not a full html, css, js kind of thing but maybe like some kind of dsl. this is also like shader toy or similar. do you 100% need accounts for this? 

## exquisite corps drawing toy 

start a drawing, get a share url. send it to a friend, they can see the bottom 1/3rd (ish) of the drawing. they complete that and and send it to a friend. once its been sent to like 5 people, it gets unveiled. sqlite stores the status of drawing and a list of nicknames. logic to dump images in cloudflare or s3.

## simple game with a level editor

like a sokoban style puzzle game with a level editor. make levels and store them in db to share

## free sound beat machine

drum machine app that gets search sounds from free sound

## game pigeon type clone: async turn based game

like game pigeon pool. email for "your turn"

#### dump

- also interested in playing with web sockets?
- guy dupont's bumper the sticker is so cool.
